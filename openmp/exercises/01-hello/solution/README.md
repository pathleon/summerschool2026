# Discussion

*Note for instructors: use `run*.sh` scripts to generate all the output files.*


## Task: Compiling and running

1. Compilation succeeds.

2. Outputs are in `hello-cpus1.out` and `hello-cpus4.out`.

3. Output is in `hello-omp2.out`.

4. Output with 8 threads in `hello-cpus8.out`.out`.


## Task: Library functions

1. See `hello-1.{cpp,F90}`. Output in `hello-1-cpus4.out`.

2. See `hello-2.{cpp,F90}`. Output in `hello-2-cpus4.out`.

   Note that each thread calls `omp_get_num_threads()` in this code.
   This is unnecessary and we'll see later how to execute this function call only with a single thread.


## Bonus task: Conditional compilation

1. The linking fails to undefined reference to `omp_get_thread_num()` and `omp_get_num_threads()`.

2. See `hello-3.{cpp,F90}`. The C++ version includes `omp.h` only if `_OPENMP` is defined and declares dummy functions otherwise. The Fortran version uses `omp_lib` module only if `_OPENMP` is defined and provides stub `contains` functions otherwise.
